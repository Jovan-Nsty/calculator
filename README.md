# calculator
Calculator project made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Note: This project was challenging due to the nature of mathematical concepts and algorithm needed for stringing together several operations.
It's fully functional with current operations. Only thing missing is the implementation of decimal numbers and operations between them. 
Those will be implemented in the future.
